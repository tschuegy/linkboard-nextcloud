## [1.5.4] – 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- Migration `Version001009Date20260316000000` also calling `$result->free()` instead of `closeCursor()`, causing fresh installations to fail (same issue as v1.5.3 fix, but in the earlier migration)

## [1.5.3] – 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- Migration `Version001010Date20260317000000` calling `$result->free()` which does not exist on Nextcloud 33's `ResultAdapter`, causing `occ upgrade` to fail and leaving Nextcloud stuck in maintenance mode (replaced with `closeCursor()`)
